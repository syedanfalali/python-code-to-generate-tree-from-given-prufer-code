# prufercode-to-tree
    From this code we can convert a prufer sequence into tree in form of matrix.
initially give input as length of required prufer sequence then after enter 
each vertex elements in the prufer sequence in order.
    It will generate prufer list and vertex list at every iterarion clearly step
by step.Finally desired tree is generated in matrix form.
